# Repository Purpose
# Mục tiêu Repository

This repository is a complete learning roadmap for developing FRC robots using Java and WPILib.

The goal is not only to build a working robot, but also to learn software architecture, engineering workflow, testing, documentation, and long-term project maintenance.

Repository này là lộ trình học hoàn chỉnh để phát triển robot FRC bằng Java và WPILib.

Mục tiêu không chỉ là làm robot chạy được, mà còn học kiến trúc phần mềm, quy trình phát triển, kiểm thử, tài liệu hóa và bảo trì dự án lâu dài.

## docs/

Contains the repository engineering standards.

Chứa các tiêu chuẩn kỹ thuật của toàn bộ repository.

Typical contents:

- Frozen Backbone
- Frozen Interface Contract
- Engineering Standard
- Architecture Documents
- Observation Architecture and Model Contract

`Document_C` formally defines `frc.robot.observation` as the permanent
top-level package for immutable, vendor-neutral read models.

`Document_C` chính thức định nghĩa `frc.robot.observation` là package
top-level cố định cho các read model bất biến và độc lập với vendor.

## real_robot_programming/

Contains every lesson project.

Mỗi lesson là một project WPILib độc lập.

Each lesson inherits from the previous completed lesson.

Mỗi lesson kế thừa lesson hoàn thành trước đó.

## Approved Autonomous Roadmap

### A01 - Autonomous Navigation and Path Following

A01 is the approved successor roadmap after frozen
`A00_L04_AutonomousMotionSafetyGating`. Its purpose is to progress from the
autonomous command foundation to deterministic field-based trajectory
execution and PathPlanner/AutoBuilder integration.

Authority:
`docs/architecture_decisions/ADR_A01_Autonomous_Navigation_Path_Following_Roadmap.md`

Current implementation state: A01 is authorized and `module_A01` exists.
`A01_L01` through `A01_L06_PathPlannerPathAndRuntimeIntegration` are `COMPLETE /
FROZEN / READ-ONLY`. After the latest Swerve zero-offset recalibration, the user
physically executed the L06 one-meter autonomous on both Blue and Red. A slight
Blue endpoint overshoot followed by a small reverse correction was observed;
exact endpoint accuracy is not formally measured or claimed, and final
PID/feedforward and physical-model tuning remain deferred. `A01_L07` is
`COMPLETE / FROZEN / READ-ONLY` after the user-confirmed implementation,
Simulation, and real-robot verification gates passed. `A01_L08` is now
`COMPLETE / FROZEN / READ-ONLY` after the user-verified
post-repair WPILib VS Code build (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s`; 6 actionable tasks:
1 executed, 5 up-to-date), the accepted 430/430 test result, Simulation PASS,
and Real Robot PASS. The 11 initial failures were independently classified and
repaired as minimal L08 test-contract migrations, with no production defect
found. L08 preserves the locked routine-selection, readiness, alliance,
requirement, and centralized-stop contracts and is the frozen inheritance source
for L09. Exact endpoint accuracy, final PID/feedforward tuning, and final
physical characterization remain explicitly unclaimed.
`A01_L09_PathPlannerNamedCommandsAndEventMarkers` is now `COMPLETE / FROZEN /
READ-ONLY`. Its approved ADR amendment permits one safe, observable,
deterministic non-mechanism `LEARNING_EVENT` binding because D01 remains an
independent Tank Drive project with no approved shared command boundary. The
implemented `ONE_METER_WITH_EVENT` routine preserves `SAFE_STOP` as the chooser
default and the inherited `ONE_METER_PATH` routine. Repository evidence records
compileJava and compileTestJava PASS, focused L09 tests PASS, 384 unchanged
inherited regression tests PASS, the full 446/446 suite PASS, and isolated
clean-build PASS. The user supplied Simulation PASS for Blue and Red, event
dispatch and telemetry, concurrent path/event execution, Disable/mode-loss
stop, no automatic restart, and Real Robot PASS. The event remains a
non-mechanism demonstration; no Intake, Feeder, Flywheel, or other D01 mechanism
integration is claimed. Exact endpoint accuracy, final PID/feedforward tuning,
and final physical characterization remain explicitly unclaimed. A01 ends at
frozen L09; A01_L10 is not authorized. The approved V00 successor roadmap is
registered below, but no V00 module or lesson has been created or started.
A00 is closed at A00_L04; A00_L05 is not authorized.

Approved lesson sequence:

1. `A01_L01 - Autonomous Starting-Pose and Field-Frame Contract`
2. `A01_L02 - Pose-Targeted Autonomous Motion`
3. `A01_L03 - Trajectory Generation and Sampling Fundamentals`
4. `A01_L04 - Field and Alliance Transform Contract`
5. `A01_L05 - Holonomic Trajectory Following`
6. `A01_L06 - PathPlanner Path and Runtime Integration`
7. `A01_L07 - AutoBuilder Contract Integration`
8. `A01_L08 - Autonomous Routine Selection and Safe Composition`
9. `A01_L09 - PathPlanner NamedCommands and Event Markers`

### V00 - AprilTag Vision Observation and Pose Fusion

V00 is the approved successor roadmap after frozen
`A01_L09_PathPlannerNamedCommandsAndEventMarkers`.

Authority:
`docs/architecture_decisions/ADR_V00_AprilTag_Vision_Observation_and_Pose_Fusion_Roadmap.md`

Current state: roadmap `APPROVED / FROZEN`; `module_V00` is authorized as the
future independent module location but is `NOT CREATED`. V00_L01 is `NOT
CREATED / NOT STARTED / NOT ACTIVATED`. No camera or vendor implementation is
selected.

V00_L01 must inherit from frozen A01_L09 through the standard copy, rename,
generated-artifact cleanup, baseline-build, and transition-guide workflow only
after a separate activation decision.

Approved lesson sequence:

1. `V00_L01 - Vision Coordinate Frames and Camera Extrinsics`
2. `V00_L02 - AprilTag Field Layout Contract`
3. `V00_L03 - Vision IO and Immutable Observation Contract`
4. `V00_L04 - Deterministic Vision Simulation`
5. `V00_L05 - AprilTag Robot Pose Estimation`
6. `V00_L06 - Vision Measurement Quality Contract`
7. `V00_L07 - Vision Timestamp and Latency Contract`
8. `V00_L08 - Real Vision Adapter Integration`
9. `V00_L09 - Swerve Pose Estimator Vision Fusion`

The roadmap preserves frozen S00 and A01, RobotContainer's composition-root
role, vendor-neutral VisionIO and Observation contracts, read-only telemetry,
SwerveSubsystem ownership of `SwerveDrivePoseEstimator`, autonomous consumption
of `getEstimatedPose()`, and A01_L04 ownership of the sole alliance transform.
Vision measurements use canonical WPILib field coordinates and are not
alliance-flipped. Simulation must use independent ground truth, must not use
EstimatedPose as camera truth, and must pass before real-robot fusion
verification.

No camera/vendor is selected in V00_L01 through V00_L07. V00_L08 may select one
real implementation only after the ADR's hardware, WPILib 2026, vendor-version,
timestamp, dependency, and applicable simulation compatibility gate passes.
